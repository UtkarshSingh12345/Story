first we init a git and then we make some files on it.
and then make a .gitignore file and save all the files inside it.
and all the files get ignored by git in the master,action and the locla stage.
and then we do git add .  and then we do commit by git commit -m "ile name".
To clone things you go to the github account and which ever file you want take the url .
and come to your master repository and do cloning by git clone link.
and donot commit it .
and now to make a experimaental branch we have made a git branch "branch name".
and then if we made anything in the branch nothin will be happen to the original branch .
so you can make many original baranch and switch to any branch by git checkout "branch name".
now to add things from local stage to the remote stage we write git remote add origin "link of remote repository".
now to push it git push origin master.
